# Walmart-Sales-Analysis

#### Motivation

This project was created as part of work prepared for the NUS Datathon 2025 Advanced Category, where the task involved making sense of real retail data. The focus was to study sales behaviour across Walmart stores and departments and understand how weekly performance changes over time. The project provided a structured way to practise data cleaning, visualisation, and basic modelling in Python while working with a dataset that reflects real operational patterns in retail.

#### Methodology

The analysis uses the Walmart sales dataset, which contains weekly sales records, department identifiers, store information, and date-related attributes. The dataset is first cleaned and reviewed for missing values. Summaries and visualisations such as histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and time-series charts help highlight trends, compare stores, and examine seasonal effects.

Feature engineering includes extracting useful date features and forming simple groupings to study variation across time and departments. Linear regression is used to examine relationships between sales and selected predictors. The results are interpreted in a straightforward manner to identify variables that may influence weekly sales and to gain a clearer view of store-level performance.
