# Walmart-Sales-Analysis

#### Motivation

This project explores sales patterns in the Walmart dataset as part of a data analysis exercise. The aim is to understand how different factors affect weekly sales across stores and departments. The work focuses on simple and clear analysis that highlights trends, variations, and relationships in the data. This project also provides practice in using Python for data cleaning, visualisation, and basic modelling.

#### Methodology

The analysis uses the Walmart sales dataset, which includes weekly sales values, store information, department identifiers, and date-related features. The data is first cleaned and checked for missing values. Basic summaries and visualisations such as histograms, boxplots, and line plots are used to inspect sales trends over time and across stores.

Feature engineering includes extracting useful date features and creating simple groups for comparisons. Models such as linear regression are tested to explore how variables relate to sales. The results are interpreted in a straightforward way to understand which factors may influence weekly sales and how store performance varies.
